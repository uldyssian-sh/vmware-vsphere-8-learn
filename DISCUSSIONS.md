## Course Feedback

**Suggestion: Container integration**
Would love to see more content on vSphere with Tanzu and Kubernetes integration. This seems to be a growing area.

**Suggestion: Multi-cloud scenarios**
Real-world environments often span multiple clouds. Any plans to add hybrid cloud management topics?
